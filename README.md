# BuyVsRent

This is a practical basic calculator to assist in making a decision between buying a house or continuing the rent. The decision is purely from investment 
standpoint. 

Two scenarios are calculated. One, where the downpayment is made to the house with monthly payments in form of mortgage and other home expenses. In second scenario, downpayment amount is invested with additional annual contributions equal to the difference between mortgage+home expenses and the rent. For example, if mortgage is 1800, home expenses are 1000 and rent is 1500. The difference of 1300 a month or 15600 a year would be contributed towards investments annually.
